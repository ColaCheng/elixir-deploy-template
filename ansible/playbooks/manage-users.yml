# Manage users
#
# Initial bootstrapping
#
# On a cloud server where the provisioning process adds a keypair to the root
# user, the initial setup can be:
#
#   ansible-playbook -u root -v -l web-server-01 playbooks/manage-users.yml -D
#
# On a physical server where we start with a root account and no ssh keys, we
# need to bootstrap the server the first time, specifying the password with -k.
#
#   ansible-playbook -k -u root -v -l web-server-01 playbooks/manage-users.yml
#
# Insead of `root`, the initial user might be `centos` or `ubuntu`.
#
# On macOS the -k command requires the askpass utility, which is not installed
# by default, so it falls back to Paramiko, which doesn't understand
# `.ssh/config`, so we need to set host's IP in the `ansible_host` variable.
#
#   ansible-playbook -k -u root -v -l web-server-01 playbooks/manage-users.yml --extra-vars "ansible_host=123.45.67.89"
#
#
# On following runs, after the script has created an admin user for you, run:
#
#   ansible-playbook -u $USER -v -l web-server-01 playbooks/manage-users.yml
#
